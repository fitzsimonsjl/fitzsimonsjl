### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cloud DFIR things, and few other personal projects (with a security focus) in between.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m aiming to learn as much as I can about cloud security - specifically Azure and AWS.
- ðŸ’» When I find the time, I write things about privacy and security, or take photos - you can find both [on my blog](https://fitzsimonsjl.com)
